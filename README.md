- Question
```What is “image segmentation”?```
- Answer
```Image segmentation is the process of partitioning a digital image into multiple segments (sets of pixels, also known as image objects). The goal of segmentation is to simplify and/or change the representation of an image into something that is more meaningful and easier to analyze.```
- There are several applications:
    - Machine vision
    - Medical imaging
    - Object detection
    - Recognition Tasks
    ...
